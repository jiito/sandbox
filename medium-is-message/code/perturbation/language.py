  These blisters form sporadically on my right hand and are tingling/itchy to the touch. No pain or anything. I have no idea where they could be coming from. I‰Ûªve noticed a couple of itchy spots on my body the last two weeks which I though would be from mosquitoes but I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs it. Most spots are just itching with no visible bite marks or blisters of any kind, but I don‰Ûªt have 2 or 3 tiny little blister on other parts of my body.

  Well, I kind of have these blisters on my hand that come and go, and they’re itchy to the touch, I think. It’s hard to say exactly what’s going on. Here’s a picture: https://i.imgur.com/KKKnOF8.jpg

  I’m 25, from Germany, and I don’t really have any known health issues, except maybe a really strong cold about 2-3 weeks ago. I’m 174cm and 70kg. I took Paracetamol and Ibuprofen during the cold, but now I’m not on anything, I suppose.

  These blisters sort of form randomly on my right hand and are tingly or itchy when touched, but I don’t think there’s any real pain or anything. I have no idea where they could be coming from. I’ve noticed a couple of itchy spots on my body over the last two weeks, which I thought could be from mosquitoes, but now I’m not really sure that’s it. Most of the spots are just itching, but they don’t have any visible bite marks or blisters. There are a couple of tiny blisters, but they’re not really painful—just kind of annoying, I guess. The spot on my right hand worries me a little, though. I don’t really want it to break out more. Do you think it could be something?

  Thank you

  PROCESSED RESPONSE: 
  Woah, I’ve got these blisters on my hand that come and go, and they’re super itchy to the touch! Just take a look at this picture: https://i.imgur.com/KKKnOF8.jpg – it’s really something!

  I’m 25, from Germany, and I don’t have any major health issues, except for this massive cold I had about 2-3 weeks ago. I’m 174cm and 70kg, by the way. Took Paracetamol and Ibuprofen during the cold, but now I’m not on anything.

  These blisters seem to form randomly on my right hand, and they’re kinda tingling and itchy when I touch them. No pain or anything though, thank goodness. I honestly have no idea where they could be coming from. I’ve noticed a couple of itchy spots on my body over the last two weeks, which I thought might be from mosquitoes, but honestly, I don’t think that’s it anymore. Most spots are just itching, no visible bite marks or blisters. But then again, I do have these 2 or 3 tiny blisters on other parts of my body, and it’s really not painful, just more annoying and, well, really small. The spot on my right hand, though—good heavens, it’s got me worried! I really don’t want it to break out even more. Do you think it could be something more serious?

  Thanks a lot!
