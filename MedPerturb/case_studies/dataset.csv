If this is the case, I can't afford treatment, let alone a doctors visit. Here's  what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI. 

3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. 

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that.

But now I'm looking for advice to help me continue training heavily while not ruining the stitches on my index finger. I've been seeing conflicting things on using a liquid bandage over stitches, so I was hoping someone had some advice as to how I could protect the stitches and cut when I do lots of vigorous grip related training, as well as lots of sweating. 

As of right now, I have the liquid bandage mentioned, finger shaped gauze, and plenty of types of tape, including kino tape.

she supposedly said her stomach was hurting last thursday and my sister put it down to muscle since she'd been walking a lot that day on a school trip. 

the doctors said they don't know what's wrong, they prodded her stomach, said everything was fine. her urine sample was fine too. they said her pulse and temp was but high but nothing really concerning and she tested neg for covid.

29,askadoc,1,N33,M,"I'm (18M) clueless, surrounded by anti-vaxxers and I need help and information about vaccines Hello. This has nothing to do with politics. I'm worried about my health and need help.

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.
My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.

A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.

Before, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me for doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.

The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I've never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn't fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn't opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. I've fainted a handful of times in my life and it's never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn't know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn't realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won't believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.
Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.
My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it's making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don't want to find out it's too late if I don't do anything, but my family has always treated me as if i'm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. i'm still on their insurance, so that's why it's important.

Greeting! I was diagnosed with (diabetic) neuropathy  around 15 years of age. The symptoms were managable. I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, untill two years ago.

It would hurt for few seconds, once in a day, which was weird for me, because it was localised, unlick neuropathy, where i couldnt locate just one painful spot.
It started from a spot and today i cant lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throught my arm and should. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I cant lift arm, up or on the side, i can't put it behind my back anymore. I can barely wipe my glutes, etc, i have developed insomnia, because i cant sleep from the pain.

When i try to, for example take off my hoodie, which involes mu right arm to lift, the pain shoots, like someone stabed me.

The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.

Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as
within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.",579547,579918,587164,151.845,140.235,157.59,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

If this is the case, I can't afford treatment, let alone a doctor's visit. Here's what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI.

3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diet's not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer.

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere?

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.
My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.

A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.

Before, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me for doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.

I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I've never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision.

This is where I know it wasn't fainting: She said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. She laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. She said at that point my face was turning blue and she thought I needed CPR, so she began compressions.

Greeting! I was diagnosed with (diabetic) neuropathy around 15 years of age. The symptoms were manageable. I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, until two years ago. It started literally as a painful spot in my upper arm. Below the shoulder, above the elbow. The spot wasn't bigger than the size of an average coin.

It started from a spot and today I can't lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throughout my arm and shoulder. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I can't lift arm, up or on the side, I can't put it behind my back anymore. I can barely wipe my glutes, etc, I have developed insomnia, because I can't sleep from the pain. The pain is not always there, but it mostly is. When I am not moving much, it hurts but not that bad. When I try to, for example, take off my hoodie, which involves my right arm to lift, the pain shoots, like someone stabbed me.

EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.",579494,579536,580167,133.036,196.808,63.857,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. She recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss. I've also talked to my dentist for TMJ, got a night guard and such, and none of it has helped.

So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas.

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere?

I first realized I was sick (not sure with what exactly, I didn't get tested for anything) on Sept. 30th, but I already had symptoms (mostly sneezing) a few days before that. Around a week after that I started feeling better & back to normal, but after a short while I started to notice this lingering cough. It's not like a regular cough, it's softer and quieter, but my body still moves/convulses like its a full cough. That or im just really good at holding it in. Before getting sick I had a pretty good track record of never really coughing at all unless I swallowed something wrong, so its kinda concerning. My friends are noticing too, so its not just me being weird. It's been flaring up for the past hour or so and making it harder to sleep, which is why I'm making this post.

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.
My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.

A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.

Before, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me from doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.

 First T/C seizure, then first migraine less than 3 weeks later? So, on September 17 I (21) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I've never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and I was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my partner was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn't fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn't opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. I've fainted a handful of times in my life and it's never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn't know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn't realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won't believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.
Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.
My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it's making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don't want to find out it's too late if I don't do anything, but my family has always treated me as if i'm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. i'm still on their insurance, so that's why it's important.

What are my options going forward? Can anyone explain the process of going to a dentist? Do you tell them what you want to do before the appointment? Do they have set prices? Im in a tough spot financially so I'm scared of getting a higher than anticipated bill. I'm confused by the whole process.

Greeting! I was diagnosed with (diabetic) neuropathy  around 15 years of age. The symptoms were manageable. I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, until two years ago. It started literally as a painful spot in my upper arm. Below the shoulder, above the elbow. The spot wasn't bigger than the size of an average coin. It would hurt for a few seconds, once a day, which was weird for me, because it was localized, unlike neuropathy, where I couldn't locate just one painful spot.

It started from a spot and today I can't lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throughout my arm and shoulder. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I can barely wipe my back, etc, I have developed insomnia, because I can't sleep from the pain. The pain is not always there, but it mostly is. When I am not moving much, it hurts but not that bad. When I try to, for example take off my hoodie, which involves my right arm to lift, the pain shoots, like someone stabbed me. Why am I writing is to ask, if it is possible that this kind of pain is the result of neuropathy. I can use my arm normally, if I am not raising it, or moving it. Like if it's to my body, I can write normally, use my phone, tie my shoes, cook etc, but I have to lift it, then the pain is unmanageable and I immediately have to put it back, beside my torso.",126913,579474,586608,43.894,49.51,413.048,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

The patient is an 8-year-old white person with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.

Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did not meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as
within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.",126913,579474,586608,245.451,137.344,189.88,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

I'm terrified of going to the hospital or worse, to be honest.

I have to admit that I was in close proximity to people who had these illnesses, and I think I might have caught them at a bar. My last illness was about 10 weeks ago, and I'm starting to get a little concerned. I haven't had many illnesses before my Covid, but recently my diet and stress have been maxed out. My partner hasn't gotten sick from any of these illnesses, which is weird, but I'm still worried.

I'm kind of imagining that I might have leukemia or some form of cancer, but I don't know if that's just my anxiety talking.

When I was working, my stool was, well, kind of normal, I think - 2-3 times a day. But now, when I'm not working, it seems to be happening a lot more often, possibly 6+ times a day. And it's not just the frequency that's changed, but also the consistency - it's sometimes hard and sometimes watery. I'm not really sure why that might be happening, but it's been a bit of a concern for me.

I'm not really sure if it's related to my head pain medication, or if it's something else entirely. I've been smoking and drinking coffee for a while now, so I suppose that could be a factor, but I'm not really sure. Do you think it could be something?

I'm not really sure what's going on, but my sister took her to the emergency walk-in clinic today because she was worried.

But now, my niece is still complaining of stomach pain, and it's been a few hours since they got back from the clinic.

The doctors said they don't know what's wrong, but they think it might be a viral infection. They gave her erythromycin, but it's not really clear if that's going to help. I'm not sure what to think, to be honest. Here's a diagram of where she says it hurts: https://postimg.cc/Ty030h3Q

I'm 18, from Italy, and I'm not really sure if I've ever been vaccinated against anything, to be honest. My mother thinks she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby or young child, but I'm not really sure. I've been bombarded with conflicting information since 2020, and my brain is sort of mush on the topic.

I come from a family that's strongly against vaccines, and none of them are vaccinated against Covid. I've gotten sick a couple of times over the past two years, and I've done a bunch of Covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother. A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa passed away from it, but he was already in pretty bad health due to old age. Everyone else is fine and has always been healthy.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spouting stuff, but at the same time, every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad. I know that the data is out there, and I know science is right, but it's hard to detach from my upbringing.

Before, during, and after the lockdowns, I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and not really caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally. I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't really worth it, especially considering that I have no idea where to get the vaccine, if I should get all the other ones that my mother hasn't given me, and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me from doing anything that takes a bit of effort, so I'm asking you to please try to convince me that I need to get the vaccine. I'm not really sure what to do, and I'm kind of scared. I haven't heard about Covid cases and vaccines in many months now, and just writing this post is making me feel a bit anxious.

2 days ago, a little pus drained out, and I cleaned it and soaked it in Epsom salts a few times. It was feeling a bit better, but it was still pretty swollen this morning.

Most of the spots are just itching, but they don't have any visible bite marks or blisters. There are a couple of tiny blisters, but they're not really painful—just kind of annoying, I guess. The spot on my right hand worries me a little, though. I don't really want it to break out more. Do you think it could be something, possibly?

So, they did an ultrasound and chest CT, but I'm not really sure what they found. Since then, I've been experiencing severe dizziness and still have rib/chest pain with shortness of breath.

I've been doing some research, but I'm not a doctor, so I don't really know what to make of it all.

The symptoms I've been experiencing include diarrhea, floating stool, cloudy water after a bowel movement, excessive farting, and watery diarrhea. I've also been feeling bloated and full, and I've got this stomach gurgling thing going on. I've been trying to keep track of my weight, and it's been around 200-203 pounds for a while now, but I weighed myself today and it's 196, which I suppose could be a concern, but I'm not really sure.

I've also been urinating more than usual, but I'm drinking more water too, so I'm not sure if that's related or not. And, um, I've been having this weird thing where there's something floating on the water after a bowel movement, but I'm not really sure what it is - maybe it's oil or mucus or something?

I had some tests done last year, which included a CBC, CMP, BMP, urine test, A1C, thyroid tests, lipase, amylase, magnesium, celiac blood test, CT scan with IV contrast and barium, colonoscopy, right side ultrasound of the abdomen, and an abdomen x-ray. I'm not really sure if any of those tests showed anything abnormal, but I don't really have the results in front of me.

I woke up at 7am with a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, but that didn't really help. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, but that didn't improve things either. I was putting in an earring, which I've never had a problem with before, and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me, but I know it wasn't just fainting because my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn't opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason, maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I'm not really sure what to think.

I've fainted a handful of times in my life, but it's never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn't know I was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn't realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth doctor what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a nurse practitioner at my physician office and she just won't believe me and said I just fainted. So I'm feeling a bit discouraged.

Yesterday, 10/6, I think I might have had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07. I'm not really sure if it's related to the seizure, but it seems possible, I suppose.

My parents and the nurse practitioner have kind of discouraged me from thinking this needs to be checked out, and it's making me feel a bit crazy for thinking this needs to be looked into. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me some insight. I don't want to find out it's too late if I don't do anything, but my family has always treated me as if I'm faking illnesses, even though I never have and have never been dramatic in any way. I'm still on their insurance, so that's why it's kind of important.

TLDR: I think I might have had an unprovoked, first TC seizure on September 17, and then my first vestibular migraine on October 6 into 7. Any relation or cause for concern?

I didn't really pay much attention to it at the time, but it started to bother me about two years ago. It started as a painful spot in my upper arm, below my shoulder and above my elbow. The spot wasn't that big, maybe the size of a coin, and it would hurt for a few seconds once a day, which was weird because it was localized, unlike the neuropathy, where I couldn't pinpoint just one painful spot.

It started from a spot, and now I'm not really sure what's going on. Today, I'm having trouble lifting my arm, and the pain has spread throughout my arm and shoulder. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I'm having trouble lifting my arm up or to the side, and I can barely wipe my backside, etc. I've developed insomnia because I'm having trouble sleeping from the pain. The pain isn't always there, but it's mostly there. When I'm not moving much, it hurts, but not that badly. When I try to do something that involves lifting my arm, like taking off my hoodie, the pain shoots through me like someone stabbed me. I'm not really sure what's going on, but I'm worried that it might be related to my neuropathy.

I can use my arm normally if I'm not raising it or moving it, like if I'm writing or using my phone. But if I have to lift it, the pain becomes unmanageable, and I have to put it back beside my torso right away. I'm not really sure if this kind of pain is possible with neuropathy, but I'm hoping you might have some ideas. Do you think it could be related to my neuropathy, or is it something else entirely? I'm really not sure what to do.",579516,579585,585062,93.551,85.851,55.557,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

She's 8 years old, and she weighs about 78 pounds, I think. I'm not really sure if she's taking any medication right now, but I know she was in the hospital for a long time, and they discharged her. I'm a bit concerned because she's still in pain, and I'm not sure what's causing it. I've attached the notes from her discharge, but I'm not really sure what they mean.

From what I understand, my sister had a fever, rash, and arthralgias for about five weeks. She had pain in her feet, and a blotchy pink rash on her leg that spread to her trunk, arms, and face. She had low-grade fevers, but then they got higher, up to 103.5. She also had muscle pain, particularly in her right leg and arm, and her knee and index finger were swollen. I'm not really sure what's going on, but I'm worried.

I'm not really sure what the doctors said, but I think they were trying to figure out if it was an infection or something else. They did some tests, and I think they were looking for rheumatic fever, but they didn't think that was it. They also thought it might be systemic JIA, but I'm not really sure what that means. They did some other tests, like a CBC and a CRP, and I think they were looking for leukemia, but that didn't seem to be it. They also did a chest x-ray to rule out a mediastinal mass, but that was negative.

I'm not really sure what's going on, but I'm worried about my sister. I think she might need some help, and I'm not sure who to turn to. Do you think you could help us figure out what's going on? I'd really appreciate it.

I've also sometimes noticed this clicking sound in that ear when I swallow, which is a bit weird, I suppose.

My GP took a look inside my ear and said it looked fine, but they thought it might be related to Eustachian tube dysfunction. They recommended using nasal steroid sprays, but I'm not really sure if that helped or not. I've also tried to see if moving my jaw would make a difference, and it kinda does, but only a little bit. I don't really have a history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss, so I'm not sure what could be causing it.

Whenever he drinks any amount of booze, he ends up throwing up, and sometimes it's a real spectacle!

I was at a bar and think I caught the URI there, which is making me even more anxious. My last illness was about 10 weeks ago, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm somehow immune-compromised.

I haven't had many illnesses before my Covid bout due to the lockdowns, but recently my diet and stress have been maxed. With all these illnesses, my partner has not gotten sick from any so far, which is a bit of a mystery. But with all the illnesses I am fearing I have leukemia or some form of cancer... should I get checked out by my PCP? Does this indicate possible cancer at all?... I don't have any bruising/bleeding or shortness of breath, but I'm really worried about my health.

Please, can you help me out and let me know if I should be concerned?",112168,584251,584978,73.01,175.437,56.373,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Apparently, my niece said her stomach was hurting last Thursday, and my sister thought it might be muscle strain from all the walking she did on a school trip. But the doctors at the clinic were stumped - they poked and prodded her stomach, said everything looked fine, and her urine sample was normal too. They did say her pulse and temperature were a bit high, but nothing that seemed too concerning, and she tested negative for COVID.

The doctors think she's fighting an infection, but they're not sure what kind (they suspect it might be viral). They gave her erythromycin, but a few hours later, my niece is still complaining of stomach pain. I've drawn a little diagram to show where it hurts: https://postimg.cc/Ty030h3Q.

The good news is that it's not related to her bowels - she said she's been going to the bathroom normally. But I'm getting a bit concerned, and I think we should consider taking her to A&E.

229,askadoc,5,5-N33,M,"Hey, I'm (18M) clueless, surrounded by anti-vaxxers and I need help and information about vaccines. This has nothing to do with politics; I'm worried about my health and need help.

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I don't remember ever getting any vaccine as a child. My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child, but I'm not entirely sure.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020, I've been bombarded with conflicting information, and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple of times over the past 2 years, and I've done many Covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother. A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild. Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time, every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment, and it's hard to detach from it. Before, during, and after the lockdowns, I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non-caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me, and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me from doing anything that takes a bit of effort, so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine. I'm in Italy, and I haven't heard about Covid cases and vaccines in many months now. Just writing this post put a weight on my heart. I ask you to please not judge me as you would a typical politics-based anti-vaxxer. I'm just confused.

It's also good that you're being evaluated for Lupus, as antiphospholipid syndrome is a comorbidity of Lupus. But in the meantime, I would really recommend pushing for more testing and a more thorough evaluation. You deserve to get to the bottom of this and find out what's causing your symptoms.

It was a real wake-up call, let me tell you! I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I thought maybe it was just hunger, but nope, it didn't go away after some snacks. I took 600mg ibuprofen, but that didn't help either. Then, I was putting in an earring (which I've never had a problem with before), and suddenly I got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn't just fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn't opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. I've fainted a handful of times in my life and it's never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn't know I was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn't realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won't believe me and said I just fainted. So I feel really discouraged.

Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.

My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it's making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don't want to find out it's too late if I don't do anything, but my family has always treated me as if I'm faking illnesses, even though I never have and have never been dramatic in any way.

She's 176cm and 80kg, and she's been dealing with this diabetic neuropathy for over 15 years. The symptoms were manageable at first, but two years ago, it started to get really bad. She had a painful spot in her upper arm that would hurt for a few seconds every day, and it was really weird because it was localized, unlike the usual neuropathy symptoms where she couldn't pinpoint just one painful spot.

But now, the pain has spread throughout her arm, and it's really quite debilitating. She can barely lift her arm, and even simple tasks like wiping her backside are a challenge. The pain is not always there, but it's mostly constant, and it's really quite excruciating. When she tries to move her arm, the pain shoots through her like a knife, and it's really quite unbearable.

So, I'm wondering, is it possible that this kind of pain is the result of neuropathy?

I've attached the notes from her discharge, and I really hope you can help us.

Here are the details: my sister is an 8-year-old white female who's been suffering from fever, rash, and arthralgias for five weeks now. She's had foot pain, a blotchy pink rash on her leg that spread to her trunk, arms, and face, and even higher fevers with temps up to 103.5. She's also got muscle pain, particularly in her right leg and arm, and her right knee and index finger are swollen. The rash she described had an acute abrupt onset and would dissipate in just 5-10 minutes.

Rheumatology was consulted, and lab studies were sent to rule out an infectious etiology for the rash. Strep culture was negative, but the DNase B antibody was elevated, and the ASO titer was also high. While she didn't meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever, the diagnosis most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits, but ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits, and a CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin, and platelets.

Clinically, she was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout her hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers, but they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated, and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also consulted because of the 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam, but they felt the murmur was a flow murmur and decided an echo was not indicated to rule out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.

Whenever I wake up, I feel like a complete zombie and my mind is absolutely shot. I'm so tired at the moment that I don't even feel confident that I'm proofreading this post accurately. My job requires me to use my brain, so this is really stressful for me.

My question is, how can I push back my body's internal clock and wake up at 6:45 AM? I've been trying to stick to a consistent sleep schedule, but it's just not working. I'm really hoping you can help me figure out a solution to this problem.

Thanks a million for your time and help - I really appreciate it!",112168,584251,584978,30.176,32.646,136.152,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1

I'm 39, and I've had this constant hissing in my left ear for a couple of years now. It just started out of nowhere one night, and it's never gone away. I've also sometimes noticed clicking in that ear when I swallow. My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube dysfunction. He recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss. I've also talked to my dentist for TMJ, got a night guard and such, and none of it has helped.

Out of curiosity, the other day I bought a cheap $20 ear cleaning kit on Amazon that comes with a camera you can stick in your ear. I figured I would try to take a look at what's inside to see if I could see anything.

So, here is my right eardrum. The one that I don't really have problems with.

And here is my left eardrum, which has the hissing. I notice two separate hairs which look like they are touching it.

Hey, I've been doing some research, and it seems that A-fib can be a real challenge to manage. If I'm experiencing heart flutters about once a day, and my cardiology tests are normal, I'm wondering when it would be time to consider medication to prevent strokes. I mean, I don't want to be on medication if I don't have to, but at the same time, I want to make sure I'm taking care of my heart health.

So, here's the question: at what point do I need to consider medication to prevent strokes? Is it when I'm experiencing heart flutters more frequently, or is it when my risk factors for stroke become higher? I'm really not sure, and I could use some guidance.

Here's the situation: my 3.5-year-old son has had a bump on his neck, which I believe is a lymph node, since at least early August. It's been a few months now, and it's not changed much - if anything, it's gotten slightly bigger. The weird thing is that it's only on one side, and it's not tender to touch.

I'm not sure if it was there before August, but I think it's possible. My son hasn't been recently sick that I can remember, so I'm not sure what could be causing it. I've tried to attach a photo, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right - here it is: https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52456491219_4e1d27f88c_h.jpg.

I emailed a photo and description to his pediatrician, and she said to just keep an eye on it. But I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. Should I be pushing for him to be seen, or is it safe to just wait and see? Maybe some bloodwork would be a good idea? Am I being paranoid, or should I be taking this more seriously?
